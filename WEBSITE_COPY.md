## Your Team Spends 15+ Hours a Week on Documents and Emails That Software Should Handle

**Cut admin time by 80%. Keep every document, email, and policy answer inside your own walls.**

---

## Who This Is For

**This is for you if:**
- Your team manually enters data from invoices, BOLs, or contracts
- Client emails sit unanswered because nobody has time to draft proper responses
- Staff ask the same policy questions every week—and nobody knows where the answer lives
- You've avoided AI tools because you can't risk client data leaving your systems

**This is not for you if:**
- You're looking for a chatbot to put on your website
- You need consumer-facing AI features
- You're comfortable with your data flowing through OpenAI or Google

## How It Works

### Step 1: Connect Your Document Flow
Upload invoices, contracts, delivery notes, or emails. Our system classifies, extracts key fields, and checks compliance—automatically.

### Step 2: Build Your Knowledge Base
Ingest your internal policies, procedures, and SOPs. Staff get instant, accurate answers with source citations. No more hunting through shared drives.

### Step 3: Automate the Repetitive Work
Email classification. Response drafting. Action item extraction. Document summarisation. The tasks that consume hours become minutes.

**Everything runs on your infrastructure. Your data never leaves your control.**

## Your Data Stays Yours

We built this for firms that can't compromise on confidentiality.

| Concern | Our Approach |
|---------|--------------|
| **Data residency** | Runs entirely on your infrastructure. Nothing transmitted externally. |
| **Third-party AI** | No OpenAI. No Google. No Anthropic API calls. Open-source models only. |
| **Client confidentiality** | Your documents are never used to train models. Ever. |
| **Audit requirements** | Full audit trails on every operation. Enterprise tier includes compliance logging. |
| **Multi-tenant isolation** | Each client's data is completely separated. No cross-contamination. |

**We don't see your data. We can't see your data. That's the point.**

## Common Questions

**How long does setup take?**
Most firms are processing documents within 48 hours. Self-serve signup takes 5 minutes. First automation typically runs on day one.

**What documents can it process?**
Invoices, contracts, delivery notes, bills of lading, purchase orders, permits, quotes, and receipts. Email classification works with any business communication.

**Do we need technical staff to run this?**
No. The system runs in Docker containers with a simple web interface. If you can use email, you can use this.

**What happens if the AI gets something wrong?**
Every output includes a confidence score. Low-confidence results are flagged for human review. You set the threshold—we recommend 0.7 for most use cases.

**Can we try it before committing?**
Yes. Demo mode lets you test with your real documents. No credit card required. No time-limited trial pressure.
